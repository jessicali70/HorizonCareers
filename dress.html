<div class="container-out" id="intro">
  <div class="container">
    <p>Whether they admit/realize it or not, everyone, including your future interviewers, has unconscious biases toward someone based on his or her appearance. Therefore, it is especially important to make a good impression with your attire.</p>
    <p>You should dress according to the specific position you are applying for. There is no universal dress code, as there are varying expectations of what you wear, depending on your geographical location, the season, and the industry or company you are applying for a job in. Research the company’s culture to see what you should wear. If you are still unsure of what to wear, you can always call the company to ask what you should wear. This demonstrates a genuine concern and desire to make a good impression.</p>
    <p>In general, there are a couple of categories in which each company’s dress code falls in: conservative and business casual or start-up style.
    </p>
    <p>
    While conservative wear should be for very professional jobs, such as law firms, banks, or finance, business casual or start-up style wear are much preferred in companies such as hippie design companies or San Francisco startups.

    <p>Start planning out your interview outfit right after your interview has been confirmed. This way, if do not have certain shoes or proper clothes to wear, you’ll have time to go out and buy them.
However, if you find yourself missing parts of a fitting wardrobe at the last minute, always go for more formal than not. As many businesses condone “dressing down” for interviews, it is always more appropriate to be on the more conservative side.</p>
    <p>Even if a dress code is considered “business casual” and employees may wear their everyday clothes to work, never show up to an interview with comfortable clothes such as sweats and a run-down T-shirt. “Business casual” still does have a “business” aspect to it.</p>
  <p>Don’t wear any scented perfumes or cologne, and definitely make sure you don’t reek of sweat of anything else unpleasant. Bad smells are immediate bad signs to employers.
